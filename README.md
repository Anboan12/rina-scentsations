# Modern & Colorful Multi-Page Website

This zip contains a ready-to-deploy static website with 4 pages:
- `index.html` (Home)
- `about.html` (About)
- `services.html` (Services)
- `contact.html` (Contact)
- `css/styles.css` (shared stylesheet)

How to deploy (GitHub Pages):
1. Create a new GitHub repository and push all files to the `main` branch (or `gh-pages` branch).
2. In the repo settings -> Pages, set source to the branch and root folder `/` and save.
3. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

Notes:
- Forms in this demo are client-side only and use `alert()`; replace them with your form provider or server code.
- Replace placeholder text, images, and branding as needed.
